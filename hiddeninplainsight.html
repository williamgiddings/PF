			  <h2>Hello</h2>
			  <p>My name is William G̘ḭ͎̱̀ḏ̢̻̣̞d̹̺̝̖̠̦ͅi̦̺͞n̰̹̠̻g̥̗͇͓͎̺̘ṣ̻. I am a Games Development Student from Lincolnshire (UK). I have always had a fascination with the magic video games; as a passionate admirer and as a contributor of what I believe to be the quintessential art form. No other form of creative media involves as many different forms of art as video games do. The combination of the visual, audio and story telling arts allow video games to engage the full potential of the player's senses and emotions. As an aspiring developer, I want to make games that stimulate the soul, not just our brains.

			  <h2><strong>More About Me</strong></h2>
			  <p>As well as making games, I also get involved with analogue photography. It helps me see the world in a different way and gives me the satisfaction of finding a reality so subtle that it becomes more than reality. This is a concept that I like to reflect in the creation of my games.</p>

			  <h2><strong>Favorite Games</strong></h2>
			  <ol>
				<li><i><strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R - Call of Pripyat (2009)</strong></i></li>
				In my opinion, the best in the series. No game I've ever experienced quite has the atmosphere or sense of being as this game. The RPG elements and the ever extant world have kept me returning and becoming lost for years.
				<li><i><strong>No Man's Sky (2016)</strong></i></li>
				The sense of scale and unimportance of the player in this game is truly humbling. The infinite expanse of living and breathing worlds shrouded in mystery have always evoked my childlike wonder of the universe, still keeping me in awe to this day.
				<li><i><strong>Quake (1996)</i></strong>
				Being the first video game I was ever introduced to, it will always trigger some nostalgia in me. After recently going back and replaying it, I have found a new love for the game. It's creature design, atmosphere and levels are outstanding for a game of its time. It still remains fun, intuitive and challenging. This game is timeless, and will always have a place in my heart.
				<li><i><strong>Sea of Thieves (2018)</i></strong></li>
				A game that is liberating and beautiful to play solo, and that is full of drama and hilarity to play with friends. Some of my fondest moments in online gaming were expireinced playing this game, no other game of its kind truly comes close to the intimacy of the multiplayer in Sea of Thieves. Whether you're fighting off a Megalodon with a your friends and a crew of strangers or boarding a group of rival player's to steal their loot; you will always have a blast playing this game. Pair this with the breathtaking visuals and the sense of freedom, this game is without a doubt one of my favorites. 
				<li><i><strong>Garry's Mod (2004)</i></strong></li>
				I have more hours clocked on this <i>game</i> than I care to admit yet it will always have a place on this list as it is what introduced me to programming and games development. I have a lot to owe to this game in terms of my career and the memories I have had over the years with friends new and old. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Maybe_its_okay/recommended/4000/">This review</a> by Steam user: <i>Slightly Expired Yoghurt</i>, sums up my opinions on the game perfectly.
